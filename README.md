Problem Statement

The Super Store Sales Dashboard provides insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. It helps businesses identify their top-selling products, most profitable categories, and regional sales distribution. The dashboard also highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, profit margin, and order volume, enabling strategic decision-making.

By analyzing sales data, businesses can improve inventory management, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, identifying underperforming categories helps in making informed marketing and promotional decisions.
